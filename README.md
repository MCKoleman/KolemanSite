# Kristian Kolehmainen<br/>Personal Portfolio
Repository for my personal portolio [koleman.dev](https://koleman.dev).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tools
This project was made using JavaScript, NodeJS, and React. I also used TailwindCSS for styling the website.

## Features
While there are still more things to potentially add later down the line, I am happy with the simplistic design currently. A feature that is still work in progress is a built-in codeviewer to display source code of projects on separate pages for each project.
